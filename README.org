# =dotfiles=

A collection of my dotfiles on a public repo so I can easily configure my systems.

## Usage
For easiest use, install [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) 

+ Fedora -- `sudo dnf install stow`
+ Ubuntu -- 'sudo apt install stow'

Clone the repository to your `$HOME` path.

Change directories to `~/dotfiles` and use `stow <directory name>` to symlink your configuration files.

Instructions for additional tool instructions are not provided here.
